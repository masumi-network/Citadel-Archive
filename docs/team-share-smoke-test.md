# Citadel Team Share Smoke Test

Last updated: 2026-06-03.

Use this checklist before sharing Citadel setup with teammates or agents.

## What To Share

For Codex-compatible agents:

```bash
npx skills add masumi-network/citadel-archive --skill citadel-archive
```

For agents that cannot install skills:

```text
https://citadel-archive-production.up.railway.app/skills
```

Give each teammate or agent identity its own `ctdl_...` token. Use reader tokens
for search-only work and writer tokens only when the agent should ingest durable
context. Rotate any token that was pasted into chat, logs, issues, PRs, or public
files.

## Verified State

Verified on 2026-06-03, production commit
`3c70e92171b5a82e7aa99609b3d0596c3379127e`.

- `npx skills add masumi-network/citadel-archive --skill citadel-archive` installs
  the `citadel-archive` skill from `skills/citadel-archive/`.
- Public endpoints return `200` for `/healthz`, `/.well-known/citadel.json`,
  `/skills`, `/skills/connect`, and `/static/login.js`.
- Hosted MCP initializes at `/mcp/`, lists 13 tools, and exposes
  `citadel_discovery`, `citadel_session`, `citadel_search`, `citadel_ingest`,
  `citadel_backup_mirror_status`, `citadel_run_backup_mirror`, and
  `citadel_audit_events`.
- A writer token successfully reads and ingests through direct HTTP.
- A writer token successfully reads and ingests through hosted MCP.
- A hosted MCP `citadel_session` call is recorded in `/api/audit?view=mcp` as
  `mcp.citadel_session`.
- Backup mirror dry-run returns `ok=true`, `written=false`, and
  `published=false`.
- Railway `Citadel-Archive` production service is `SUCCESS` and `RUNNING` on the
  same commit.

## Public Endpoint Smoke Test

```bash
export CITADEL_BASE_URL=https://citadel-archive-production.up.railway.app

curl -fsS "$CITADEL_BASE_URL/healthz"
curl -fsS "$CITADEL_BASE_URL/.well-known/citadel.json" | python3 -m json.tool
curl -fsS "$CITADEL_BASE_URL/skills" | python3 -m json.tool
curl -fsS "$CITADEL_BASE_URL/skills/connect" | sed -n '1,80p'
```

## Token Smoke Test

Keep token and vault output out of public repos, issues, PRs, and shared chats.

```bash
export CITADEL_BASE_URL=https://citadel-archive-production.up.railway.app
export CITADEL_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN=ctdl_... # paste locally; never commit

curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $CITADEL_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  "$CITADEL_BASE_URL/api/session" | python3 -m json.tool

curl -fsS -X POST "$CITADEL_BASE_URL/search" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CITADEL_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"query":"repositories commits events","dataset":"masumi-network","top_k":3}' \
  | python3 -m json.tool
```

## Hosted MCP Checks

A plain `curl` GET to `/mcp/` is not a valid MCP client request. The endpoint
expects streamable HTTP with `Accept: text/event-stream` or a real MCP client.
Legacy `/mcp` redirects to `/mcp/` with a relative `Location` header.

Expected MCP results with a writer token:

- `initialize`: `200`
- `tools/list`: includes 13 Citadel tools
- `citadel_session`: role `writer`, `read=true`, `write=true`
- `citadel_search`: `200`
- `citadel_ingest`: `200`

## Safety Notes

- One token per teammate or agent identity.
- Minimum role by default: reader for search, writer only for ingest.
- Never paste raw tokens or vault search output into public places.
- Rotate exposed tokens immediately.
