# Read-side Hardening Sprint (issues #25–#49)

Status doc for the production-readiness sprint that resolves the heavy-user +
pentest findings filed as GitHub issues **#25–#49**. Self-contained so a fresh
session can resume without external scratch state. Last updated 2026-06-30.

## Origin

Two rounds of black-box testing against the production node surfaced a broken
read/write data plane behind green dashboards. Root insight: durable writes were
routed through cognee's per-session cache, which corrupted them to the literal
`[DataItem]` and never indexed them. See memory `citadel-session-id-cache-corruption`.

## Done — merged to `main` (auto-deployed to Railway), each with tests

| PR | Issues | Summary |
|----|--------|---------|
| #54 | #26, #32 | Durable writes go through cognee's permanent `add+cognify` path, not the session cache. **Verified live on the node** (a marker ingested post-deploy returns as real cognified text, `belongs_to_set: []`). |
| #56 | (latency) | `run_in_background=True` so ingest returns promptly instead of blocking on inline LLM cognify (fixed a timeout the #54 verification exposed). |
| #57 | #29 | MCP `citadel://` resource reads thread the caller token via `mcp.get_context()`. |
| #58 | #31 | `cognify` exits nonzero on failure: LLM-key guard + top-level `ok` reflects the `--verify` canary. |
| #55, #59 | #37 | Service version single-sourced from `kb.__version__` (hatchling dynamic); node reports real 0.2.1 instead of `0.1.0`/`0+unknown`. |
| #60 | #49 | Clamp search `top_k` to `[1,100]` at the `Citadel.search` chokepoint; 413 byte cap on `/ingest` + `/api/contribute`. |
| #61 | #30, #42 | Surface `authenticated` flag + warning on both syncers; repo-content `ok:False` (exit 1) when all repos error; webhook re-ingest records mesh errors. |
| #62 | #34 | Marker-based repo auto-join (AGENTS.md/CONTEXT.md/SKILL.md, opt-in) + index AGENTS.md. |

**Closed:** #26, #29, #30, #31, #32, #34, #37, #42, #49.

## Batch 2 + follow-ups — SHIPPED (PRs #64–#68)

A follow-up stress sweep added #50–#53. All remaining issues were investigated
(grounded fix specs below, kept for reference), implemented, tested, merged, and
**live-verified on the node**.

**PR #64 — batch 2 (11 commits, 601 tests):** #51/#53 (MCP ingest inline cognify +
byte cap), #45/#33 (MCP 406 Accept shim + role/seat `tools/list` filter), #39/#48
(promotion read-timeout + **admin-gated** approve/reject — closed a seat
self-promote-to-Central hole), #40/#41 (durable feedback + improve guards), #28
(get_document drilldown), #35/#36/#38/#43 (onboarding), #27 (honest
status/doctor/readyz + corpus-gate 503), #44/#50 (parallel search + timeout budget
+ 429/Retry-After/X-RateLimit + client retry), #46/#52 (Linear per-issue→Central +
surfaced failures), #47 (Kuzu writer lock + cross-process cognify guard), #15
(admin dry-run-first graph cleanup).

**Follow-ups (live prod testing exposed gaps unit tests couldn't):**
- **#65 — real #47 fix.** The hourly `Lock is held by PID` came from `remember()`'s
  per-ingest `cognee.remember(run_in_background=True)` cognify firing in BOTH the
  web and the evolve Phase-1 subprocess. Now: subprocess add-only
  (`CITADEL_SUPPRESS_INLINE_COGNIFY`), web cognify writer-lock-guarded.
- **#66 — real #46 fix.** Auto-map Linear assignees→seats by member email
  (`LinearClient.fetch_users`), no manual `CITADEL_LINEAR_USER_MAP`.
- **#67 — real #15/#52 fix.** The `[DataItem]` *in search* was cognee's per-session
  QA cache (`source:session`), read FIRST by `recall()`; gated behind
  `CITADEL_COGNEE_SESSION_RECALL` (default OFF).
- **#68 — vector cleanup.** Scaffolds were also cognified into the
  `DocumentChunk_text` vector store; `delete_graph_nodes` deletes vector points too
  + the cleanup adds a search sweep for orphaned chunks.

**Verification + status (2026-06-30):**
- **16 closed + live-verified:** #27, #28, #33, #35, #36, #38, #39, #40, #41, #43,
  #44, #45, #48, #51, #52, #53. Live: MCP 406→200, search + rate-limit headers,
  get_document 200, promotion authz reader→403, readyz honest, search returns 0
  `[DataItem]`.
- **#15 DONE + verified clean:** admin cleanup looped to dry — 214 garbage
  nodes/chunks purged across session cache + Kuzu graph + pgvector; all prod
  searches return 0 `[DataItem]`/marker/session, 746 real docs indexed.
- **Open, pending runtime verification (next hourly evolve pass):** #47 (Kuzu — no
  `Lock is held by PID`), #46 (Linear `mirror_count`>0 after the auto-map sync;
  the HTTP force-resync times out on ~200 inline writes — known perf gap).
- **Open, partial:** #50 — backpressure/429 done; raw ~6–9s latency is
  cognee-recall-bound (separate perf effort).
- **#25 (umbrella) CLOSED:** its defects — version skew, `[DataItem]` search,
  doctor/status, ingest→index, sync/cognify/get_document/resource-auth,
  onboarding/MCP — are all resolved & verified. #46/#47/#50 are later-sweep
  findings tracked separately, not part of #25.
- **Lesson:** the `[DataItem]` garbage lived in three distinct stores (session
  cache, Kuzu graph, pgvector chunks). Graph deletion ≠ vector deletion ≠
  session-cache; **live prod testing was essential — unit tests passed at every
  wrong layer.**
- **Action:** rotate `CITADEL_ADMIN_KEY` (surfaced in-session during ops).

## Fix specs (shipped in batch 2 above — kept for reference)

Each was investigated and has a concrete, conservative fix. Approach summary:

- **#45 MCP 406 + #33 admin-tool filter** (`kb/mcp_server.py`, `kb/server.py`):
  - #45: FastMCP streamable-HTTP returns 406 unless `Accept` lists *both*
    `application/json` and `text/event-stream`. Add a pass-through ASGI shim on
    the mounted `/mcp` app that augments the `Accept` header so minimal clients
    (Pi) connect. LOW.
  - #33: `tools/list` advertises all 21 tools incl. 6 admin tools to writer
    seats. Add a request-scoped role-aware filter (resolve role via
    `resolve_client(ctx).get("/api/session")`, hide tools whose
    `ROLE_ORDER[policy.role]` exceeds the caller; fail open). Keep server-side
    403 as defense-in-depth. LOW.
- **#28 get_document drilldown** (`kb/server.py`, `kb/cognee_client.py`): cognee
  CHUNKS hits carry a synthetic `chunk:{sha}` id with no backing store →
  `get_document` 404s. Add a vector-store chunk resolver (or thread a resolvable
  `doc_` id into cognee external_metadata at ingest) and advertise a working
  `/api/documents` endpoint for chunk hits. MED.
- **#46 Linear sync fail** (`kb/linear_sync.py`): evolve linear stage fails every
  cycle on a runtime `LinearAPIError` (auth/scope/rate-limit — needs
  `LINEAR_API_KEY`, likely a runtime secret, not a code bug) that `run()`
  swallows; `mirror_count 0` because no Linear assignee email matches a seat
  email. Surface the fetch failure as structured `ok:False` + add
  assignee/seat-email diagnostics. LOW (code); runtime secret needed to fully
  resolve.
- **#39 + #48 promotion** (`kb/promotion_client.py`, `kb/promotion.py`,
  `kb/server.py`, `kb/cli.py`):
  - #39: a read `TimeoutError` escapes `_request`'s URLError-only handler →
    raw traceback + exit 0. Catch `TimeoutError`/`OSError` in `_request`;
    decorate the four promotion CLI handlers with `@_needs_server`.
  - #48: approve/reject gate on `require_access("writer","kb:ingest")`, so a
    seat-writer passes and a bogus id 404s before any admin check (a real item
    lets a seat self-promote into Central). Require `("admin","sources:sync")`
    so the role gate 403s before id resolution; align the two MCP ToolPolicy
    entries. MED — security-relevant.
- **#40 + #41 writer-seat** (`kb/service.py`, `kb/cognee_client.py`,
  `kb/cli.py`): both are false-green CLI bugs. #40 feedback drops silently
  (`recorded:false`, exit 0). #41 improve crashes three ways (UNIQUE
  `users.email` / empty graph / missing LLM key) and exits 0. Surface a clear
  reason + nonzero exit per failure mode; make cognee's default-user bootstrap
  idempotent. MED.
- **#35/#36/#38/#43 onboarding** (`kb/cli.py`, `kb/onboard.py`,
  `kb/tool_detect.py`, `kb/capture_config.py`): the interactive capture wizard
  wrote an empty `capture.json` (flipping the pre-push hook to fail-closed),
  never collected an LLM key, installed Claude session hooks at project scope,
  and left Claude MCP snippet-only. Seed the repo root (never persist empty
  roots, #43), offer an OpenRouter key (#35), move session hooks to
  `~/.claude/settings.json` + doctor check (#38), promote Claude to a write-tier
  `claude mcp add --scope user` handler + pi/keychain note rewording (#36). MED,
  largest item.

## Design/high-risk specs (shipped — kept for reference)

- **#27 health gates** (`kb/status.py`, `kb/service.py`, `kb/server.py`): make
  `check_search` honest (`ok = count > 0`) and fold it into `report.healthy`;
  add an indexed-docs-vs-tracked-sources corpus-volume gate; wire the existing
  `cognify_dataset(verify=True)` canary into `/readyz` or the evolve scheduler.
  Note: canary `ok = search_hit OR graph_grew` passes on growth alone — tighten
  with a short retry given background cognify.
- **#44 search timeout** (`kb/server.py`, `kb/service.py`, `kb/cognee_client.py`):
  `citadel_search` times out ~100s+. May partly ease now that #26 removed the
  `[DataItem]` bloat — re-measure on the node first, then address the cognee
  recall/search perf path. HIGH.
- **#47 Kuzu single-writer lock** (evolve scheduler / `kb/server.py` /
  `kb/cognee_client.py`): `cognify_session` crashes hourly (`Lock held by PID`).
  Serialize Kuzu writers / coordinate cognify so concurrent writers don't
  collide. HIGH — concurrency, live graph. See memory
  `citadel-evolve-cognify-concurrency`.

## Follow-up — #15 DONE (verified clean)

- **#15 purge legacy garbage** — DONE (PRs #67/#68 + admin cleanup loop). The
  `[DataItem]` garbage lived in THREE stores: cognee's per-session QA cache (the
  search-visible source — recall read it first; fixed by disabling that read), the
  Kuzu graph, and the `DocumentChunk_text` pgvector store. The admin cleanup
  (`POST /api/admin/graph/cleanup`) now deletes from graph + vector and sweeps via
  search; looped to dry — 214 nodes/chunks purged. All prod searches return 0
  `[DataItem]`/marker/session; 746 real docs indexed.

## Working agreement for this sprint

- One compartmentalized branch per issue/group off `main`; test (full `pytest`)
  before merge; merge = prod deploy (auto-deploy on `main`).
- Low-risk fixes auto-merge; the three HIGH-risk data-plane/concurrency items
  (#44, #47, and the data-plane work already done) get a node verification.
- No `Co-Authored-By`/"Generated with" trailers (repo convention).
