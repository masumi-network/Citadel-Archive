# Citadel Proactive Ingest

Capture durable engineering knowledge into Citadel **as it happens**, with no
per-session ceremony. Four autonomous layers — dev-side hooks plus server-side
cron — all **fail-silent** and **personal-by-default** unless explicitly promoted.

1. **Mid-session, agent-driven.** While working, the agent proactively calls
   `citadel_ingest` for durable facts and decisions. Personal-by-default.
2. **Git push, hook-driven (universal baseline).** On every `git push` (all
   IDEs), a pre-push hook snapshots commit metadata to the dev's **Node** —
   install once per clone.
3. **SessionEnd, hook-driven (optional).** On every session close (Claude
   Code), a non-blocking hook distills the transcript and POSTs a short note to
   the dev's **Node** — zero per-session steps after a one-time token export.
4. **Server-side Railway cron (org-wide).** Scheduled jobs sync GitHub org
   digests, Linear workspace → **Central** with **Seat-Scoped Mirrors**, skills
   catalog refresh, self-improvement, and backup mirror export. Devs never
   trigger these manually.

```
Personal node:  seat:{slug}   (the dev's private Citadel node — default target)
Shared Central: masumi-network (org-wide; Promotion Agent + org sync — not seat tags)
Hosted base:    https://citadel-archive-production.up.railway.app
```

Setup first (token + MCP): `https://citadel-archive-production.up.railway.app/skills/connect`
Read/write rules: `https://citadel-archive-production.up.railway.app/skills/vault`

## Personal-by-default (read first)

| Personal (default) | Shared Central |
|---|---|
| No `dataset` field on writes | **Promotion Agent** (hourly evolve cron + on demand) |
| Lands in your `seat:{slug}` node | Org GitHub / Linear sync (operator cron) |
| Only you (+ Central readers) can read your node | Whole org reads promoted **Central** copies |

A **seat-writer token** carries `default_dataset=seat:{slug}`. Send writes with
**no `dataset` field** and the server's `resolve_write_targets` routes them to
your private **Node**. Seat-scoped writes **never** dual-write to **Central**
via tags — ADR-0007 **Seat Node Write Policy**.

**Central** updates for your notes happen when the **Promotion Agent** rules
pass (known masumi-org work) or when you **approve** a **New Org Project**
proposal in the **Operations Dashboard**, MCP, or `citadel promotion` CLI.

## Layer 1 — proactive mid-session ingest (agent behavior)

While working in an org repo, when a durable fact crystallizes, call
`citadel_ingest` without waiting to be asked. Keep each note small and curated.

**Ingest proactively when:**
- A decision is made (approach chosen, tradeoff settled, library picked).
- A non-obvious root cause is found, or a bug class is understood.
- An interface/contract, env var, or config invariant is established.
- A reusable runbook or "how we do X here" emerges.

**Personal-by-default call (lands in your node):**

```
citadel_ingest(
  data="Picked urllib over requests for the SessionEnd hook so it stays "
       "stdlib-only and dependency-free.",
  tags=["dev-session", "decision"],
)
```

No `dataset` field → seat **Node**. Tag with context (`adr`, `runbook`, repo
name) for search — tags do **not** route seat writes to **Central**.

**Never ingest** (same rules as `citadel-vault`): secrets, tokens, keys, seed
phrases, PII, raw logs/debug dumps, ephemeral chatter, or large uncurated
dumps. Summarize durable decisions and source facts instead.

> **Install:** all hooks are now bundled in the `citadel-archive` package
> (`kb.hooks.*`) and installed by **`citadel onboard`** — no vendored scripts.
> See the [`citadel-onboard`](../citadel-onboard/SKILL.md) skill. The sections
> below describe what each hook does and how to wire it by hand.

## Layer 2 — SessionEnd auto-sync (the hook)

`python -m kb.hooks.sync_session` runs from a Claude Code `SessionEnd` hook. On
every session close it:

1. reads the hook payload (`transcript_path`, `cwd`, `session_id`,
   `hook_event_name`) from STDIN;
2. parses the transcript JSONL **defensively** (skips malformed lines, never
   crashes);
3. distills a **short, deterministic** note — 1-2 line recap, key decisions,
   files changed, notable facts — with **no local LLM call**;
4. derives `tags = ["dev-session", <git-branch>, <repo-name>]`;
5. truncates to `CITADEL_MCP_MAX_INGEST_BYTES` (default 200000);
6. POSTs `{data, tags}` (NO `dataset` → personal node) to `{base}/ingest` with
   `Authorization: Bearer ${CITADEL_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN}`, **HTTPS only**;
7. **fails silently** — catches everything, exits 0, never blocks session
   close, never prints the token.

Server-side LLM enrichment (`CITADEL_LLM_ENRICHMENT_ENABLED`) does any deeper
structuring after the note lands; the hook stays deliberately dumb and fast.

### One-time token setup (the only step)

Get a **seat-writer** token from the connect wizard
(`https://citadel-archive-production.up.railway.app/skills/connect`) and export
it once:

```bash
export CITADEL_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN='ctdl_...'
```

That's it. The same token already powers `citadel_search` and the MCP config,
so most devs already have it set. With it in the environment, every session
auto-syncs to your private node. With it unset, the hook is a clean no-op.

### Wire the hook into a repo

`citadel onboard` merges a `SessionEnd` hook into `.claude/settings.json` whose
command is `"<python>" -m kb.hooks.sync_session`. To do it by hand, add that
command under `hooks.SessionEnd` with `allowedEnvVars: ["CITADEL_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN"]`.

## Layer 3 — Git push auto-sync (universal baseline)

`python -m kb.hooks.sync_push` runs from a git **pre-push** hook. On every push it:

1. reads pre-push ref lines from STDIN (or HEAD when invoked manually);
2. collects commit hash, message, author, branch, and changed file paths — **no
   raw diffs**;
3. POSTs `{data, tags}` with `tags = ["git-push", <branch>, <repo>]` (NO
   `dataset` → personal **Node**), HTTPS only;
4. **fails silently** — always exits 0, never blocks `git push`.

**Install:** `citadel onboard` writes a self-contained `.git/hooks/pre-push`
that runs the bundled module. To do it by hand:

```bash
printf '#!/bin/sh\n"%s" -m kb.hooks.sync_push "$@" 2>/dev/null || true\nexit 0\n' \
  "$(command -v python3)" > .git/hooks/pre-push
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
```

Same `CITADEL_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN` as SessionEnd and MCP. Works in Cursor, Codex,
and Claude — any tool that uses git. This is the **only required dev-side sync
step** for non-Claude IDEs.

### Approved Capture Roots (opt-in allowlist)

By default the push hook captures from every repo. To scope capture to chosen
folders, run the setup wizard once — it writes `~/.citadel/capture.json`:

```bash
citadel setup                                   # interactive
citadel setup --root "$HOME/work/repo=org-work" # or non-interactive
```

Each root carries **Capture Root Tags**: `personal` (never promoted to Central)
or `org-work` (eligible for Promotion Agent review). The token is **not** stored
in the file — it stays in the environment.

Once the config exists, `sync_push.py` only captures pushes from inside an
Approved Capture Root (others are skipped with a warning), and the matched
root's tags ride along on the snapshot. A missing/empty/corrupt config **fails
closed** (captures nothing) — it never silently re-enables global capture.
Capture on demand with:

```bash
citadel capture --dry-run   # preview per-root summaries (no network)
citadel capture             # POST git-metadata + README summaries to your Node
```

Hardening notes: the Node URL must be **HTTPS** (`citadel capture` refuses
`http://` before sending the token, and never follows redirects). Summaries are
size-capped (`CITADEL_MCP_MAX_INGEST_BYTES`, default 200000) and git-remote
credentials are redacted. `citadel capture` exits **non-zero** on any failure
(corrupt config, no matching root, missing token, or a per-root POST error), so
it is safe to gate CI on.

## Layer 4 — Server-side Railway cron (org-wide)

Background jobs on Railway keep **Central** and **Seat-Scoped Mirrors** fresh.
Devs and agents **never** need to trigger these — cron is the source of truth for
org-wide source material.

| `CITADEL_RUN_MODE` | What it syncs | Typical schedule |
|---|---|---|
| `learning-agent` (or `github-sync`) | GitHub org digest → Central | Daily (`0 8 * * *` UTC) |
| `linear-sync` | Linear workspace → Central; assignee issues **Seat-Scoped Mirror** → each **Node** | Daily or hourly (operator choice) |
| `pipeline` (also `all`/`cron`) | GitHub sync + skills refresh + self-improve + backup mirror (each stage env-toggleable) | Daily |
| `evolve` | Self-evolving cycle: github sync → repo-content → self-improve → promotion → Linear sync → cognify (each `CITADEL_EVOLVE_*`-toggleable) | Every 1h via the in-process scheduler in the web service (`CITADEL_EVOLVE_SCHEDULER_ENABLED`, `CITADEL_EVOLVE_INTERVAL_SECONDS=3600`) — not a separate Railway service (promotion/cognify need the web's single-writer Kuzu volume) |
| `backup-mirror` | Vault Backup Mirror manifest export | Daily |

Key env vars (Railway cron service / web service — not dev shells):

- `CITADEL_LINEAR_API_KEY` — required for `linear-sync` (and the evolve Linear stage)
- `CITADEL_EVOLVE_SCHEDULER_ENABLED` / `CITADEL_EVOLVE_INTERVAL_SECONDS` — the hourly in-process evolve scheduler (web service; default `3600`)
- `CITADEL_LINEAR_USER_MAP` — optional JSON map Linear user id → seat slug
- `CITADEL_GITHUB_ORG`, `CITADEL_GITHUB_SYNC_*` — GitHub org sync scope
- `CITADEL_PIPELINE_*_ENABLED` — toggle individual pipeline stages

Manual admin triggers (only when the user explicitly asks):

- `POST /api/github-sync/run` or MCP `citadel_run_learning_agent`
- `POST /api/linear-sync/run`
- `POST /api/learning-agent/optimize`

## Agent sync policy

**Rely on cron + hooks — do not add dev ceremony.**

| Situation | Agent action |
|---|---|
| User asks a project/architecture question | `citadel_search` (Central + own **Node**) |
| User asks "what do I need to do?" / task list | `citadel_linear_my_issues` (**Seat-Scoped Mirror** in own **Node**) |
| Org-wide Linear context | `citadel_linear_search` (Central) |
| Durable fact crystallizes mid-session | `citadel_ingest` (personal-by-default; promote with tag only when user asks) |
| Git push or session close | **Nothing** — hooks handle it automatically |
| Org source material stale | **Do not** trigger admin sync unless user explicitly requests a refresh |
| User asks to run learning agent / Linear sync now | Admin tools only, with approval |

All background sync (hooks and cron) is **fail-silent**: outages never block git
push, session close, or agent work.

## Privacy posture

- **Token from env only.** Read solely from `CITADEL_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN`; never
  printed, echoed, or written to a tracked file.
- **Distilled, not raw.** The hook sends a curated short note, not the
  transcript.
- **Personal-by-default.** No `dataset` field on auto-sync → your seat node.
- **HTTPS only.** The POST refuses any non-`https://` base URL.
- **Non-blocking.** The hook always exits 0; a Citadel outage never delays your
  session close.

## Opt-out

Drop a `SessionEnd` override into `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored), or
simply unset `CITADEL_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN` for that shell. With no token the hook
does nothing. See `README.md`.
