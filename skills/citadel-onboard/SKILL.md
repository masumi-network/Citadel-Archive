description: One-command teammate onboarding for Citadel. Use when a teammate wants to set up Citadel in a repo — connect their seat token, install the autonomous git-push + SessionEnd capture hooks, add the Citadel MCP server, and (optionally) declare Approved Capture Roots. Triggers include "onboard me to citadel", "set up citadel", "citadel onboard", "connect citadel", "install citadel here", and https://citadel-archive-production.up.railway.app/skills/onboard.

# Citadel Onboard

`citadel onboard` collapses the whole teammate rollout into **one idempotent
command**. Install the CLI and run it from your repo — the autosync hooks are
**bundled in the package** (`kb.hooks.*`), so no vendored skill directory is needed.

```bash
pipx install citadel-archive    # the zero-dep `citadel` base client
# upgrade: pipx install --force citadel-archive --pip-args=--no-cache-dir
#          (plain `pipx upgrade` can land a stale cached build)
citadel onboard                 # or just run `citadel` on a fresh terminal — it auto-onboards
```

On a terminal you'll see the Citadel castle banner (cyan walls, bold wordmark);
`--json`/piped output is always plain. A bare `citadel` on a fresh interactive
terminal auto-enters this wizard (then shows the home screen); skip with
`--no-onboard` or `CITADEL_NO_ONBOARD=1`. It walks these steps, merging into
existing config (never clobbering) and safe to re-run:

| Step | What it does | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| **Token** | Prompts for your `ctdl_…` seat token, writes `export CITADEL_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN=…` to your shell rc (once) | yes |
| **Git pre-push hook** | Installs `.git/hooks/pre-push` → commit snapshots to your **Node** | yes |
| **Session hooks** | Merges the Claude Code `SessionEnd` + `SessionStart` hooks into user-scope `.claude/settings.json` (SessionEnd → private Node trace; SessionStart → proactive policy reminder) | yes |
| **Agent policy** | Same three-rule proactive policy for every coding agent you use — see [Proactive agent policy](#proactive-agent-policy-after-onboard) | yes |
| **MCP server** | Adds the `citadel` HTTP MCP server to `.mcp.json` (in-session `citadel_search`, `citadel_ingest`, `citadel_share_session`) | optional, default on (`--no-mcp` to skip) |
| **Capture roots** | Optional `citadel setup` wizard → `~/.citadel/capture.json` | optional, prompted |

## Where to get the token

A Citadel admin mints a **seat-writer** token — from the connect wizard
(`https://citadel-archive-production.up.railway.app/skills/connect` → Create
seat → role: writer) or from the terminal with `citadel seat create` (admin,
needs `CITADEL_ADMIN_KEY`). This one `ctdl_` seat token is the teammate's API
key. Paste it when `citadel onboard` asks. It is a secret — share it over a
private channel only.

## Security

- The seat token is written to **exactly one place** (your shell rc). The
  `.mcp.json` block references it as `${CITADEL_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN}` — the secret
  is **never** stored in project config or echoed to the terminal (the summary
  masks it).
- Every dev-side hook is **fail-silent** — if Citadel is down or the token is
  unset, your `git push` and session close still succeed.
- **Fail-closed capture:** push snapshots require Approved Capture Roots in
  `~/.citadel/capture.json`. Onboard seeds the current repo as a root; without
  roots the pre-push hook captures nothing (never "all repos by default").
- SessionEnd only reads transcripts under known agent dirs
  (`~/.claude`, `~/.cursor`, `~/.codex`, `~/.agents`).
- Opt out: unset `CITADEL_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN`, remove hooks, or delete capture
  roots.

## MCP — needed or not?

- **Autonomous background sync** (git push, session close) is plain HTTPS +
  token — it does **not** need MCP.
- **In-session vault search and proactive ingest** (`citadel_search`,
  `citadel_ingest`, `citadel_share_session`) are MCP tools. Enable MCP (default)
  if you want your IDE agent to ground answers in the vault and volunteer Shared
  Session Traces after user approval; skip with `--no-mcp` for capture-only.
- Manual ingest/search always works via the CLI (`citadel ingest`,
  `citadel search`, `citadel capture`) — both HTTP-backed against the Node by
  default (`--local` runs the in-process server stack instead).
- Onboard writes `.mcp.json` for Claude Code. To add the Citadel MCP server to
  another client, run `citadel mcp add <tool>` (auto-configures Cursor, Codex,
  Gemini, Windsurf; prints a snippet for the rest — `citadel mcp list` shows
  targets).

## Non-interactive / scripted

```bash
citadel onboard --non-interactive --token "ctdl_…" \
  --repo /path/to/repo --shell-rc ~/.zshrc --no-capture
```

Flags: `--token`, `--node-url`, `--repo`, `--shell-rc`, `--no-mcp`,
`--no-capture`, `--non-interactive`. Exits non-zero if no token is available.

## Check status (the dashboard replacement)

Teammates have no web dashboard — the CLI is the window into Citadel.

```bash
citadel status      # one-shot: connection, identity (seat/role), local setup, recent activity, knowledge-mesh stats
citadel doctor      # diagnose setup; `citadel doctor --fix` repairs common issues
```

`citadel status` checks the Node (`/healthz`), your token (`/api/session` →
seat + role + capabilities), a search smoke, and local setup (token in env,
`.mcp.json`, git + SessionEnd hooks, capture roots). It exits non-zero when not
connected, so it doubles as a doctor.

### Headless — for AI agents (Claude Code / Codex / Cursor) and CI

Every teammate command is fully headless: pass `--json` for a clean,
parseable object on stdout (no prompts, errors on stderr, meaningful exit codes).
Set the token in the environment (`CITADEL_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN`) so it never appears
in `argv`/process lists.

| Command | JSON shape | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `citadel status --json` | `{healthy, identity{seat_slug,role,…}, checks[…], recent[…]}` | verify connectivity / discover the seat / diagnose |
| `citadel onboard --non-interactive --json` | `{ok, repo, steps[{name,status}], token_masked}` | set a machine up (token from env) |
| `citadel setup --non-interactive --json --root PATH=tag` | the saved `capture.json` | declare Approved Capture Roots |
| `citadel capture --json` (`--dry-run` to preview) | `{ok, results[…]}` / `[…]` | push summaries to the Node |

`citadel status` additionally sees **local** hook/config state the server can't
(the MCP `citadel_session` tool is the in-session whoami). For in-session reads
and writes, prefer the `citadel_search` / `citadel_ingest` MCP tools.

## Proactive agent policy (after onboard)

Onboard installs the **same three-rule policy** for every supported coding agent
(idempotent; safe to re-run):

| Agent / tool | Where onboard writes it |
|---|---|
| **Codex, Pi, Cline, Zed**, and other AGENTS.md-aware clients | `AGENTS.md` (repo root, always) |
| **Cursor** | `.cursor/rules/citadel-agent-policy.mdc` (`alwaysApply`) when Cursor is detected |
| **Windsurf** | `.windsurf/rules/citadel-agent-policy.md` (`always_on`) when detected |
| **Gemini CLI** | `GEMINI.md` when detected |
| **Claude Code** | SessionStart hook in user-scope `.claude/settings.json` (`kb.hooks.sync_start`) |

The policy itself — agents should use Citadel **without waiting to be asked**:

1. **Search at task start** — `citadel_search` before coding (Central + your Node
   + Shared Session Traces). Trace hits are `reference-only`; Central is
   org-authoritative.
2. **Share dead-end routes with consent** — after a costly wrong turn, ask the
   user, then `citadel_share_session` (Approved Capture Root required).
3. **Never auto-share** — SessionEnd hooks write private Node traces only;
   Railway cron syncs org sources, not per-agent search or share decisions.

## Verify

Restart the shell (or `source ~/.zshrc`), then run `citadel status` (expect all
`●`), or in your agent ask: *"use citadel_search to find what we decided about
the vault."* A grounded answer means the token + MCP work.

**Claude Code (local CLI or cloud):** the token must be in the environment that
launched Claude — not only in your shell rc. Local: `source ~/.zshrc` before
`claude`. Cloud: add `CITADEL_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN` in cloud env settings. Verify
with `claude mcp list` and `/mcp` (citadel tools, not zero tools).

for the manual step-by-step and what auto-syncs.
